# Factorio mod: mojo-resource-processing
Implements a more detailed (and harder) ore mining processes. It is loosely based on the hardCrafting mod (http://www.factoriomods.com/mods/harder-ressource-processing). I also used some graphics from that mod. But in the future I might use my own assets.

## Dependecies
* Factorio >= 0.12.33
* bobores >= 0.12.7

# Plan
* Custom ore mining processes for all ores provided by bob's ores mod


# Current state
* ore crusher and pulverizer to process raw ore
* Process by-products (gravel, dirt, slag)
