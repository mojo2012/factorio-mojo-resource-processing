# Factorio mod: mojo-resource-processing
Implements a more detailed (and harder) ore mining processes. It is loosely based on the hardCrafting mod (http://www.factoriomods.com/mods/harder-ressource-processing). I also used some graphics from that mod. But in the future I might use my own assets.

Further mods I used as basis:

# Plan (maybe in another mod)
* Near future (probabely in a separate mod): 
  * More power production machinery (nuclear, wind, geothermal, etc)
  * Improved transportation (eg. splitters, barrels, pipes)
  * More high-tech products (eg. electric fences, planes, satellites)
  * More terraforming options (eg. landfill, bridges, planting/growing food)
* Far in the future (probabely in a separate mod):
  * more enemies
