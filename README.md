# Factorio mod: mojo-resource-processing
Implements a more detailed (and harder) ore mining processes. It is loosely based on the hardCrafting mod (http://www.factoriomods.com/mods/harder-ressource-processing). I also used some graphics from that mod. But in the future I might use my own assets.
Further mods I used as basis:
* http://www.factoriomods.com/mods/no-hand-crafting-fentus
* http://www.factoriomods.com/mods/burn-the-wood-advanced

## Dependecies
* Factorio >= 0.12.33
* bobores >= 0.12.7

# Plan
* Custom ore mining processes for all ores provided by bob's ores mod
* More power production machinery (nuclear, wind, geothermal, etc)
* Tree processing (robots, farms)
* Near future (probabely in a separate mod): 
  * Improved transportation (eg. splitters, barrels, pipes)
  * More high-tech products (eg. electric fences, planes, satellites)
  * More terraforming options (eg. landfill, bridges, planting, growing food)
* Far in the future (probabely in a separate mod):
  * Better textures, weather animations
  * more enemies


# Current state
* Ore crusher and pulverizer to process raw ore
* Process by-products (gravel, dirt, slag)
* Removed hand-crafting, added burner assembling machine instead
* Charcoal kiln to transform wood to coal
